C++ Programming Projects Repository
Overview
Welcome to the C++ Programming Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of C++ programs developed to cover topics ranging from fundamental concepts to advanced programming techniques. Each program is designed to enhance your understanding of C++ and build a solid foundation for further exploration in software development.
Structure of Repository
The repository is categorized into the following sections:
1. Basics of C++ Programming
- Introduction to basic syntax and data types
- Implementation of input/output operations
- Control flow structures (if, switch, loops)
- Functions and modular programming

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance
- Constructors and Destructors
- Operator Overloading

3. File Handling
- Reading and writing files
- Binary file operations
- Error handling in file operations

4. Advanced Concepts
- Pointers and Dynamic Memory Management
- Templates (Function and Class Templates)
- Exception Handling
- STL (Standard Template Library)

5. Projects
- Employee Management System- Adding, Modifying, Viewing, and Deleting Employee Records

- Other Application-Oriented Programs:- Sorting algorithms
- Searching algorithms
- Data structures implementation (linked lists, stacks, queues)
